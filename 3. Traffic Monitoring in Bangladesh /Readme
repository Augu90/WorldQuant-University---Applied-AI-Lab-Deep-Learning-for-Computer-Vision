In this project, I worked with traffic video feed data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. My goal was to process each frame of video and detect as well as label objects such as cars and people in real time. I started with a pre-trained YOLO object detection model and then extended it to detect custom objects tailored for analyzing traffic feed data.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Handling XML data containing bounding box information

Extracting frames from video files for processing

Applying a pre-trained YOLO object detection model

Training YOLO to extend its capability for detecting custom objects

Performing data augmentation to improve the modelâ€™s ability to generalize during training
