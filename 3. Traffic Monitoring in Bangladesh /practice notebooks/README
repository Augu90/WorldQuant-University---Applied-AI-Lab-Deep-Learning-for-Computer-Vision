# Project Overview #

This project focuses on analyzing traffic video feed data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The main goal is to process each frame of video and detect as well as label objects such as cars and people in real time.

I used a pre-trained YOLO model and extended it to detect custom objects relevant to traffic monitoring.

Key Learning Outcomes

Work with XML data containing bounding box annotations

Extract frames from video files for model training and testing

Apply the pre-trained YOLO object detection model

Train YOLO to extend detection capabilities for custom traffic-related objects

Perform data augmentation to improve model generalization

Tech Stack

Python

YOLO (You Only Look Once)

OpenCV – for video processing and frame extraction

LabelImg – for annotation handling (XML bounding boxes)

NumPy / Pandas – for data manipulation

Project Highlights

Real-time object detection applied to traffic video feeds

Custom training of YOLO for specific traffic analysis use cases

Enhanced detection performance through data augmentation
