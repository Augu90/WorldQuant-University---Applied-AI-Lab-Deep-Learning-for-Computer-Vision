WorldQuant University - Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision 🤖📸

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the WorldQuant University Applied AI Lab. This space showcases my learning progress and projects focused on Deep Learning for Computer Vision.

About the Applied AI Lab

The Applied AI Lab provides an excellent opportunity to explore the dynamic field of computer vision, where machines are trained to "see" and interpret images.

Offered by WorldQuant University, a leader in accessible global education, this program is fully online and tuition-free, making advanced AI learning opportunities available to all.

The lab emphasizes real-world applications through six practical projects, covering key areas such as:

Image Classification: Training models to recognize objects in images (e.g., distinguishing cats from dogs 🐶🐱).

Object Detection: Identifying and localizing multiple objects within a single image (e.g., self-driving cars detecting pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic lights 🚗🚦).

Generative AI: Creating new images with AI, including applications in deepfakes and AI-generated art 🎨.

Projects

The program includes six exciting, hands-on projects:

Wildlife Image Classification 🦁🌏: Classifying wildlife from camera trap data to support conservation.

Crop Disease Monitoring 🌿: Detecting plant diseases to improve food security for farmers.

Traffic Flow Analysis 🚗: Analyzing urban traffic patterns to help optimize flow and reduce congestion.

Face Detection & Recognition 😊: Exploring the applications and implications of facial recognition.

Medical Image Generation 🏥: Using AI to generate synthetic medical images for research and diagnostics.

Meme Generator App 😂: Building a fun application with stable diffusion models to showcase AI creativity.

Skills Developed

Through this lab, I am strengthening my expertise in:

Neural Networks: Gaining a solid foundation in the core algorithms driving deep learning.

PyTorch & Transformers: Applying industry-standard frameworks for computer vision tasks.

Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming datasets for effective model training.

Model Development & Training: Designing, training, and evaluating various computer vision models.

Model Deployment: Implementing trained models for real-world applications.
